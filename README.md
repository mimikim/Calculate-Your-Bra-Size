## Description

Inspired by the [A Bra That Fits subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/abrathatfits) on Reddit.com, this web app is for entertainment purposes only.

There is a growing movement online to free women from the wrong bra size! Adding 4 to your band measurement is an out-dated practice, originating during a time before elastic bands were created. Now in this modern age, let's re-educate cis and trans women and help them love their bodies. Men can use this web app too, if they are curious =)

It is written with vanilla javascript and is an experiment into proper namespacing.
