<h1>Calculate Your True Bra Size!</h1>
<div class="disclaimer">Inspired by the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/abrathatfits" target="_blank">A Bra That Fits subreddit</a> on Reddit.com, this web app is for entertainment purposes only.

There is a growing movement online to free women from the wrong bra size! Adding 4 to your band measurement is an out-dated practice, originating during a time before elastic bands were created. Now in this modern age, let's re-educate cis and trans women and help them love their body.

Men can use this too, if they are curious =)
